Date: 2025-12-11

## Status

Accepted

Implemented by [3. WIP Use XXX for macOS defaults as code](0003-wip-use-xxx-for-macos-defaults-as-code.md)

## Context

Configuration as code is an important part of immutable infrastructure,
which itself is great for development.

## Decision

Hire or develop a config-as-code management solution for macOS
defaults.

## Consequences

Next actions will need to be finding or developing an implementation
for Mac config as code.
